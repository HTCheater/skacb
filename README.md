# Soul Knight anticheat bypass
This is script for [Game Guardian](https://gameguardian.net/forum/files/file/2-gameguardian/) that turns off memory scanning detection. You can run your favourite scripts like you used to before the anticheat was added. 
# Running the script
As soon as loading screen appears, you need to pause the game and run the script. Also make sure to select game process again before running the script to update regions list. Once you ran the script, you can unpause the game and whatever you want.
# Using it in your scripts
I would appreciate a credit for it
